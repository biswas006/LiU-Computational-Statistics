# LiU-Computational-Statistics
The course includes computational applications of statistics and covers main topics :

-- Computer arithmetics
-- Optimization
-- Random number generation 
-- Monte Carlo methods
-- MCMC
-- Numerical model selection and hypothesis testing
-- EM algorithm and stochastic optimization (specifically genetic algorithms)

## Labs:

The programming language of the course is R and the course offers at least one application for each topic.

* Lab1: Some practices on different statistics and computer arithmetics in order to test and grasp floating points, arithmetics operations.

* Lab2: optimizing a model parameter by Golden-Section Search algorithm and BFGS, also discussion of comparison of these methods on the plot.

* Lab3: Cluster Sampling which provides sampling from a proportional set, each element does not have same probability to be drawn. And as another application of generating samples, inverse CDF and Acceptance/Rejection methods are used to generate from different distributions.

* Lab4: Implementation of Metropolis-Hasting and Gibbs sampling algorithms to generate samples.

* Lab5: Hypothesis testing, Jackknife, Confidence intervals by using bootstrap method.

* Lab6: Genetic Algorithm and EM algorithm implementations.
